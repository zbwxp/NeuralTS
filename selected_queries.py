'What guitars does James Keelaghan play?',
'Think a title fpr:David definitely could not do this. \n \nHe agreed to protect Joseph, but he did not agree to put up with the teenage angst that came with it. He was trying to run a company, live with a stranger, train said stranger and steer him to a place where he could head this company. \n \nThe young man still hadn’t presented as his final year in high school drew to a close, and as his legal guardian, David had to live with and care for Joseph – not that Joseph would make it easy for him. Since the day his parents died, the happy-go-lucky spoilt teenager turned into a sadder, angrier spoilt teenager who refused to listen to David’s very sound advice and learn the tricks of the trade. In fact Joseph made it clear that he would never listen to his parent’s last wishes. \n \nJoseph had other ideas. Stressful ideas. \n \nHe threw the letters of acceptance on David’s glass desk with a satisfied smirk. Whilst Joseph didn’t care too much about David’s appointment as the CEO of the IDM group, he cared a lot of the fact that David was his guardian, and he couldn’t so much as breathe without David’s input. \n \nDavid sighed, leaning back in his chair and rubbing the headache forming in his temples. \n \n“Joe, we talked about this.” He groaned, “Commerce, Business, IT, or Law. You’re not studying medicine. It has nothing to do with this company.” \n \n“Like I care” Joseph scoffed. “You have a choice. Either I go to Harvard which is still in the States and you can have your henchmen near to both me and you. Twenty-Five Hundred miles isn’t that far when you have a private jet. Or, I choose Oxford, Cambridge, or University of Cape Town.”\n \nNegotiating with Joe was like negotiating with a terrorist. David couldn’t win. If David said the sky is blue, Joseph said it was a colorless reflection of the ocean which was also colorless. If David said that Joseph should go left, he went right. He did things just to spite the older, knowing it would grind his gears.\n \nDavid groaned, “Would it kill you to take my advice? Can’t you respect me as your senior? As your intended mate?” \n \nJoseph rolled his eyes, falling into a chair with his arms crossed. “Firstly, you know I have a boyfriend. I’m not marrying you. You blocked my unlimited credit card because of it – even though, it’s technically my money!” he seethed, glaring at David in absolute loathing. \n \n“You were throwing money at a known gold digger! I’m not letting you blow through your money because you’re lonely!” David threw at him, banging his fist on his desk in frustration. They’d talked about this. Joe was just stubborn. \n \n“That’s not your decision to make!” he yelled back. \n \n“I think you’ll find it is!” David rolled his eyes, jaw clenching. \n \n“This is why I don’t like you.” Joseph grumbled, “But I digress. You aren’t allowed to decide my major. It’s in the will. You’re my keeper, not my boss.” \n \nJoe had him there. What was David supposed to say? He technically couldn’t resist. Knowing Joe, he would take him to court to prove a point. There was an entire trust to fund the schooling. David was backed into a corner here. Just as he always was with Joe. \n \nGlancing at the acceptance letters in front of him, David sighed and shook his head, his headache at capacity for a workday. \n \nHe glanced up at Joe, the smirk on his face made David want to throw him out of a window. He took a calming breath. “You’ll go to Harvard. If you fail once, I’ll convince the trustees to force you into law. Try me.” David growled, going back to his work. \n \n“Fine. But you know that won’t happen. You can get back to whatever boring work you’re doing here. Alex and I have a date.” Joseph sung, prancing out of David’s office with a victorious smirk. \n \nIf David knocked back three double whiskeys before he continued with work, it was no one’s business.\n\n \n \nDavid nearly killed Joe on the eve of his 28th\xa0birthday. Joseph had just finalized and passed his residency. The Marx’s and Iverson’s had thrown a huge party to celebrate the newest qualified family member. But they didn’t know what a menace that Joe was. \n \nJoe quickly became the bane of David’s existence. How could one person be so infuriating? Nevertheless, David stuck to his promise and fulfilled his duty. No matter how many times Joe made him want to throw himself off a high building for some peace of mind. \n \nIn all fairness though, the younger looked good at the age of 28. His body was sculpted, and his brain had developed in the most antagonizing way. He was a sexy 28-year-old family medicine doctor, who had fought for the past 10 years to get to where he was. \n \nIt was not without David’s help and his family’s money though. David made sure that Joe had everything he needed to succeed by not letting him want for anything. Once Joe had grown out of his rebellious teen phase and took his money and life seriously, the fights had reduced but not disappeared. \n \nAll David wanted was for Joe to take a job in LA and finally agree to be his mate. Luckily, Joe had not presented at the age of 28. There was a rumor that he was one of the exceptions to the presentation rule. It was strange but Joe could care less. He was just happy that he got to live his life without much worry. \n \nDavid, a fully grown 38-year-old Alpha, was tired of essentially babysitting a grown man. But what could he do? He had given his word. As the saying goes, a man’s word is his bond. \n \nNow, as David stood in Joe’s penthouse apartment, David had wondered when this would become worth it. \n \nThis was the first time in the last four years that David had come this apartment. Mostly because Joe’s temper and irritating thought process made it unnecessarily stressful.\n \n“Mmmh, I was wondering when you were going to show up, Davey Dave.” Joe mocked, a glass of wine swirling in his hand. He was dressed in a comfortable grey lounge set, smooth jazz playing softly in the background and candles lit to set a comfortable atmosphere. \n \n“What in the actual eff is wrong with you?” David seethed, throwing the Doctors without Borders offer letter on the coffee table. \n \nJoe barely spared a glance at the letter, his smirk rubbing David the wrong way. “Why are you so angry? This is a safe space. Maybe you should meditate? You must visit my temple Davey-”\n \n“Stop this!” David yelled, his fist clenched up at his side, brown eyes burning with anger. “First medical school and now Doctor’s without borders?! What the hell, Joseph Iverson?!” \n \n“It a great cause-”\n \n“You’re running away, Joseph.” David growled. Joe flinched slightly, not used to the older man using his full name. Despite the many ways that Joe tried to get under David’s skin, the man was unshakeable. For the first time in more than 11 years, David used his full name. \n \nIt made Joe want to kneel and ask for forgiveness, but he was as stubborn as his mother, and this is what he wanted. He wanted to make an impact! He was a doctor, and he was wealthy. He could decide what his own purpose was! What was the issue? \n \nJoe narrowed his eyes bitterly, “Running away from what? I’m practicing my profession, David!” \n \n“You are running away from your duty. You’re running away from your intended mate. For the past 10 years we have been playing hide and seek and I understood where you were coming from. But grow up, Joseph! You need to stay here!” David boomed, the veins in his neck bulging and his eyes almost disappearing as he glared back at Joe. \n \n“I’m not running away from anything.” Joe growled, his eyes flashing with anger. \n \nDavid took a calming breath, reminding himself that this man-child is his duty. He breathed in again and changed his tone. “If you’re so tired of me, I will stay away from you. I will cancel this marriage and mating. You can go on with your life. But you stay here. Kenya is too far away and way too dangerous for you to be there.” \n \nJoe laughed bitterly, placing his wine glass on the table harshly before jumping out of his seat. “You’re so self-centered. Not everything is about you, David.” He hissed, getting into David’s face. “You always do this. You make everything about you and this stupid idea that we have to be together all the time.” \n \nDavid rolled his eyes. “Are you telling me that you’ve chosen to do this because you want to suffer in a bloody war zone suddenly? That you want to live on less than an eighth of what you do now? As what? A sacrifice? What about my sacrifice? I run your family’s company in your steed – as your husband, your mate. As your Alpha – even though the only thing that ties us together is our families and my duty! I take care of you and ensure you live the comfortable life. What? You got bored of living the good life?” he retorted cynically. \n \n \n“This is exactly why we don’t get along.” Joe growled, almost nose to nose with David’s caramel skin, the anger and tension between them igniting something within him that made him want to push David over. “You’re a self-righteous drone. You think you’re so much better than everyone just because you chose to sacrifice yourself? Who do you think you are? You’ve never so much as lived for you, so who do you think you are telling me what to do? You wouldn’t know the true meaning of being an Alpha, if your knot was attached to your head!”\n \nSilence fell between them as David’s heart clenched. He refused to entertain the barb. He did what he had to do. He did what was expected. So that people like Joe could relax and follow their dreams. For that to be thrown in his face was not only hurtful, but also incredibly infuriating. His jaw clenched tight, his fist itching for a fight, but he remained silent. \n \nHe was not childish like Joe. He would not dignify the disrespect with a response. He calmed his raging inner Alpha that wanted to make his intended mate submit and respect him. This was never meant to be his place. \n \n“That’s what I thought.” Joe spat, stepping back. “That’s exactly why there will never be anything between us. You’re nothing more than a cardboard cut-out of a man and a hollow excuse for an Alpha. I’m going to Kenya. Period.” \n \nWith that, Joe went back to his couch and wine and left David standing there, heart heavy and fists flexing. The silence between them weighed for a while before David stormed out, banging the door behind him. \n \nBut nothing would prepare either of them for the realities of what they were facing. Kenya was part of the program for good reason, and nothing in his struggles since his parents’ passing would have prepared Joseph for what he bargained for.  \n ',
